# DemoCode
Collection of code used in demos around the lab

"PlottingThings" contains the code used for basedemo.md and ggdemo.md, which covers base plot and dplyr/ggplot, respectively.

"SavioStuff" contains four .md documents that review some of the basics for terminal handling, Savio submission, installing software, and the orientation powerpoint from the BRC.

Other scattered files here are used in unconnected demos
